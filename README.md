# Enhancing Cardiac Health Through Advanced Coronary Stenosis Detection And  Severity Assessment: A Deep Learning - Computer Vision Approach

## Project Objectives

• To develop an automated system that can detect and locate coronary stenosis from coronary angiograms and aid in treatment planning by estimating the degree of stenosis severity and finding the optimal stent size to be used for intervention to restore blood flow.

• The solution analyzes the angiograms robustly to cater to the varied anatomy structures of different patients, tailored to the specific characteristics of each stenotic region.

• By harnessing the power of neural networks, an experimental comparative analysis and evaluation is performed to identify the most effective model to achieve optimal performance in detecting and locating coronary artery stenosis.

• Aims to empower healthcare professionals with a sophisticated tool that complements their expertise, leading to more timely interventions, and early treatment decisions ultimately, improving patient outcomes with a streamlined system.

## Note
The associated paper describing my project work and findings has been submitted for publication and is currently under review. The neural network models were developed using TensorFlow 2.5 as their fundamental framework platform. CUDA Toolkit 12.0 and NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN), were used to perform computation on GPUS with development tools and GPU-accelerated libraries.
